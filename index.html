                <div class="pe">Can I interest in a simple and quick, yet fulfilling and nutritious meal that can be easily done in under 30 minutes? A little culinary gem for which the italian cooking gods would
                    curse me if I revealed it to the whole populace? This meal will reinvigorate your soul, give you wings (no RedBull needed!) and open your third eye. What are you waiting for?

                <div class="pe">Hey! You! Aren't you tired of stomping in butter on every piece of food you can find? Don't you wish you could make your morning toast and your oven baked potatoes a
                    little bit - pardon me - a <em>hell</em> of a lot better. Take a page out of the Middle Eastern playbook and give some actual personality to your food with this simple, yet elegant hummus recipe: </div>

                <div class="pe">Now, don't get me wrong. I like shitting on overzealous vegans as much as the next guy. But you have to give credit where credit is due. To replace meat with something that barely cosplays 
                    as food and make it taste good is no small feat. These tacos are easy and quick to make, yet their gracefulness and elegance will seduce you into a meditative trance that the Buddha
                    himself could never fathom. He obviously never included goat cheese in his veggie tacos (what a <em>loser</em>)

                <div class="pe">Are you a broke and busy college student trying to build muscle? You want people to focus on your swole arms instead of your poor social skills at parties? Well this protein packed meal
                    is perfect for you! Made in literally 10 minutes you'll be in & out of the kitchen in a heartbeat. Perfect for when you need to go back to studying, although we all know you were
                    procrastinating anyway.

                <div class="pe">Picture this scenario: you're heading in to kitchen, trying to find a healthy little snack, but you're too lazy to spend 5 minutes chopping up a little something healthy, so 
                    you reach for the bag of chips and inadvertently end up consuming the whole bag. Well if that happens to you every week (or day, I'm not judging), then these snack balls are perfect!
                    Rolling a dozen of these bad boys takes 10 minutes, and now you'll never have to reach for that tub of ice cream again!
